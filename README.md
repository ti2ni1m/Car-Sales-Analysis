# Car-Sales-Analysis

My First Year Data Science Project in Analysing Car Sales.

# Question 1:
1. Test if the mean number of cylinder is different between Mazda and Isuzu vehicles
2. Test if the mean number of seats is different for each colour. If so, determine which colour has a statistically different mean
3. Question:   
..1. Use Bootstrapping to compute a 88% confidence interval for the difference between GVM and TareWeights for Volkswagen vehicles?  
..2. Compute a 88% CI for the difference between GVM and Tare Weights for Volkswagen vehicle by using approximation.  
..3. Can we conclude that GVM weights are different than Tare Weights for Volkswagen vehicles (Don't do a hypothesis test)?  
..4. Test the hypothesis that GVM weights are greater than Tare Weights for Volkswagen vehicles  
4. Question:  
..1. Test if there is a difference in proportions of the blue vehicles between Landrover and Mercedes  
..2. Test if there is a difference in proportions of the silver vehicles between Landrover and Mercedes  
5. Question: The recent trend shows that people tend to buy more pwoerful vehicles. We would like to investigate whether there is a 
linear relationship between the registration year and the mean of the number of the cylinders  
..1. Decide if the mean numbers of cylinders and the registration year are linearly related?  
..2. If so, compute the equation to predict mean number of cylinders by using the registration year and discuss the significance of this equation?
What is your estimate of the population mean number of cylinders when the year is 1984?

# Question 2: 
1. Can a genuine causal relationship be established from this study? Justify your asnwer  
2. Can the rsults be generalised to other 14- to 16-year-old? Justy your answer  
3. What are some potential confounding factors
